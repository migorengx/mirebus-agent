# SELFHOST YOUR AI AGENT: MIREBUS SEED 🤖🌐

This repository provides a simple way to self-host your own AI agent using Docker and Docker Compose. It's designed for developers who want to quickly spin up their own AI-powered services.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Easily deploy your AI agent by setting up the necessary Docker containers and environment variables. This guide will walk you through the setup process so you can start interacting with your own AI system.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Docker installed on your system 🐳
- Docker Compose installed 🛠️
- Basic knowledge of Docker and environment variables

### Setup Environment

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. Modify the `.env` file to suit your environment, such as adding API keys or other configuration details.

## ⚙️ How to Start

To get your AI agent up and running:

1. **Start Docker**:
   If Docker isn't running, start it now.

2. **Run Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will build and start the necessary containers in detached mode.

---

## 🛑 How to Shutdown

When you're finished, you can shut down the containers with:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, freeing up resources on your system.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Customization

Feel free to customize the `.env` file and the Docker setup to fit your specific needs. You can integrate different AI models, change ports, or add more services.
